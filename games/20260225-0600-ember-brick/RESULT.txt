Implemented Ember Brick (Canvas 2D Brick-breaker) with keyboard+touch parity.
- Core loop: steer-deflect-charge-overdrive-break-sectors.
- Improvements vs 20260225-0500-circuit-shift:
  1) Real-time rebound/combo action loop instead of deterministic tile routing.
  2) Overdrive resource/timing system with burst-state gameplay.
  3) Catch-and-relaunch control option for intentional angle planning.
