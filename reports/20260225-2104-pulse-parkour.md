## Genre selection
- Recent 5 were non-platformer loops (including rhythm/survival/physics/tower-defense variants).
- Rotation priority returned to **Platformer**, with no core-loop duplication.

## Lean market research
### Trends (3)
1. Bite-sized precision platformers are sticky on browser portals.
2. Dash movement increases perceived mastery quickly.
3. Touch parity is required for mobile web replay.

### References (2)
- Celeste Classic
- N++

### Target (1)
- Players wanting short high-skill runs on desktop and mobile browsers.

## Build
- Engine: HTML5 Canvas 2D (no build).
- Inputs: keyboard + touch button set.
- Core loop: run-jump-dash-collect-cells-open-gate-escape.

## Improvements vs previous game (Sync Smith)
1. Rhythm strike loop -> spatial platform traversal loop.
2. Added vertical collision platform topology + fall reset state.
3. Added directional dash and cell-progress objective clarity.

## QA (assumed 2 playtests)
- Pass 1: jump feel tuning (less drift, clearer landing).
- Pass 2: dash feedback + HUD progress messaging.

## Ops
- Active>30 rotation applied by archiving oldest active game entry.
- Git push/deploy attempted in this run.
