Run: 20260224-1400-cinder-sentinels
Genre: Tower defense lite
Core loop: place-upgrade-hold-lanes-between-waves
Improvements vs previous: shifted from deterministic number puzzle to real-time wave defense + added economy/turret archetypes + stronger keyboard/touch tactical placement.
Playtest pass 1 (assumed): tuned enemy hp/speed and bolt fire rate for wave 1~3 readability.
Playtest pass 2 (assumed): validated touch tile placement and keyboard cursor placement parity.
Status: Built and integrated.
