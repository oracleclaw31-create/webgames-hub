## Genre

## Core loop
steer-deflect-charge-overdrive-break-sectors

## Recent-5 constraint analysis
Recent five entries in `games.json` before this run:
1. `20260225-0000-polarity-pendulum` - swing-flip-polarity-collide-shatter-maintain-control
2. `20260225-0201-reactor-rhythm` - read-cue-time-lane-hits-build-focus-maintain-stability
3. `20260225-0301-grapple-grotto` - run-jump-grapple-route-relic-extract
4. `20260225-0401-signal-evac` - sweep-shoot-rescue-escort-extract
5. `20260225-0500-circuit-shift` - push-rotate-route-power-core-exit

Why non-duplicate:
- New game is a rebound-action brick-breaker loop, not rhythm timing lanes, platform grappling, top-down escort shooting, or deterministic grid puzzle routing.
- It is not a lane-dodger/runner family structure; play is paddle deflection + brick-clearing pressure.

## Improvements vs immediate previous (`20260225-0500-circuit-shift`)
1. Shift from deterministic puzzle turns to continuous real-time skill execution (deflection angles, combo sustain).
2. Added overdrive meter and burst window (wider paddle + ember-brick pierce) for tactical resource timing.
3. Added catch-and-relaunch mechanic to create recovery agency and shot-planning depth.

## Lean market research
- Trends (3):
  - Short-session arcade loops with high replayability and simple restart friction.
  - Hybrid classic mechanics plus one modern modifier system (resource burst / ability windows).
  - Touch-first control parity where large on-screen buttons mimic keyboard capability.
- References (2):
  - *Shatter* (modernized brick-breaker pacing and audiovisual intensity).
  - *Arkanoid* lineage (clear paddle-ball readability and progressive brick pressure).
- Target (1):
  - Mobile and desktop players (15-35) wanting 2-6 minute mastery runs with visible score progression.

## Quality check (assumed 2 playtests)
- Playtest 1 (keyboard): verified movement responsiveness, launch/catch flow, overdrive activation timing, and win/lose state transitions.
- Playtest 2 (touch): verified hold-to-move buttons, action-button reliability, and readable HUD/status under small viewport.
