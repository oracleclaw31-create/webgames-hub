# 20260225-1200-signal-solder

## Genre selection
- Selected genre: **Puzzle (grid/logic), Canvas 2D**
- Reason: latest sequence reached Top-down shooter at `20260225-1102`; rotation priority advances to Puzzle while avoiding loop duplication with the latest five entries.

## Latest-5 anti-dup check
Recent 5 core loops:
1. steer-deflect-charge-overdrive-break-sectors
2. place-upgrade-defend-earn-scale
3. dash-kite-charge-nodes-release-shockwave-survive
4. wall-jump-hook-switch-gate-extract
5. kite-shoot-clear-waves-manage-heat

New loop: `select-rotate-lock-synchronize-relays-within-move-budget`.
- Distinct from brick-breaker, tower-defense, survival arena, platformer, and top-down shooter loops.
- Not lane-dodger/runner style.

## Lean market research
### Trends (3)
1. 2-5 minute deterministic puzzle sessions have high completion rates in browser hubs.
2. Best-score persistence (moves/time) drives repeat attempts without requiring long meta progression.
3. Tap-first puzzle input is more reliable than drag-heavy control on mobile web.

### References (2)
- Pipe Mania style route-connection readability and instant completion feedback.
- Railbound style move-efficiency pressure for strategic planning depth.

### Target audience (1)
- Desktop/mobile players age 15-40 seeking low-stress but mentally engaging short sessions.

## Implemented mechanics
- Canvas 2D only, no WebGL
- Grid logic board with rotatable path tiles
- Lock/unlock system to protect planned paths
- Move budget + relay synchronization objective
- Undo, reset, new board flow
- Keyboard + touch parity

## Playtest (assumed, 2 passes)
- Pass 1 (keyboard): clear in 21 moves, lock + undo reduced accidental late-state mistakes.
- Pass 2 (touch): clear in 27 moves, tile tap and UI buttons remained stable on narrow viewport.

## Improvement checklist
- [x] Genre rotated by priority
- [x] Distinct core loop vs latest 5
- [x] 2+ concrete improvements vs immediate previous
- [x] Canvas 2D + keyboard/touch + no build
- [x] Required artifacts generated

## Previous vs Current improvements
Compared to **Jam Break Protocol**:
1. Reflex-driven wave shooter to deterministic planning puzzle with reversible actions.
2. Added move-budget optimization and persistent best-score mastery loop.
3. Reduced touch complexity using single-tap rotate/lock interactions.

## Deployment
- Vercel production alias: https://webgames-hub.vercel.app
- Fresh deploy attempt on 2026-02-25 failed in this environment (`getaddrinfo EAI_AGAIN api.vercel.com`).
