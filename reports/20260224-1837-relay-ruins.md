# 20260224-1837-relay-ruins - Relay Ruins

## 1) Genre choice from recent 5
- Recent 5 reviewed: `20260224-1315-number-nexus`, `20260224-1400-cinder-sentinels`, `20260224-1510-void-bloom`, `20260224-1601-tether-crash`, `20260224-1700-tempo-forge`.
- Selected genre: **platformer (Canvas 2D)**.
- Core loop uniqueness check: `jump-dash-activate-relays-extract` is not duplicated in recent entries and is not lane-dodger/runner.

## 2) Lean market research
### Trends (3)
1. Quick-session browser play with instant retry loops remains strong.
2. Mobile-first touch controls are expected even for action platformers.
3. No-install cross-device HTML5 games keep strong casual adoption.

### References (2)
- Pikwip (itch.io web platformer).
- Vapor Trails / CrazyGames platform category patterns.

### Target persona (1)
- Mobile + desktop players seeking 3-8 minute skill runs during short breaks.
