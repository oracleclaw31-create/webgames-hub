# Rift Scrappers (v2)

Canvas 2D survival arena game with improved onboarding, smoother early pacing, and stronger mobile controls.

## Genre
- Survival arena

## Core Loop
- Pick a run module -> kite enemies -> dash through clusters -> collect scrap -> pulse clear -> choose upgrades -> survive longer waves.

## Controls
- Keyboard: WASD / Arrow keys move, Space/Shift dash, E/F pulse, 1/2/3 pick upgrade, R restart
- Touch: left move pad joystick, right Dash button, right Pulse button

## New v2 Highlights
1. Clear start overlay briefing with objective + module selection before each run.
2. Difficulty curve retuned: gentler first 20-30 seconds, then smooth scaling of spawn rate, max enemies, and enemy stats.
3. Upgrade picks are now in-game selectable cards (keyboard or tap), replacing blocking prompts.
4. New replayability mechanic: random run Modules (passive loadouts) that alter strategy each run.
5. Mobile UX improvements: larger explicit touch controls with clear labels.
