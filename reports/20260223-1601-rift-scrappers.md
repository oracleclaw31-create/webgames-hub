2. Brotato-style compact arena with build decisions between pressure spikes.

### Target Audience (1)

## 4) Improvements vs Previous Game (Ember Outpost)
1. Added direct avatar control and dash i-frame timing skill expression.
2. Added scrap economy with branching upgrades during run.
3. Added pulse meter for tactical crowd-clear timing.

## 5) Quality Check (assumed 2 playtests)
### Playtest Pass #1
