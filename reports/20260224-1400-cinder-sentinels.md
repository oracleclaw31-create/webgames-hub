- Selected genre: **Tower defense lite (#5)** following priority cycle and recent-loop avoidance.
- Core loop duplication check: passed.
- Lane-dodger/runner consecutive check: passed.

## 2) Lean market research
### Trends (3)
1. Browser players keep high retention on short wave-defense sessions with clear build phases.
2. Distinct turret roles (single-target vs splash) improve strategic readability on mobile.
3. One-tap/tap-to-place controls plus keyboard parity reduce friction across devices.

### References (2)
