Status: COMPLETE
Run ID: 20260223-1417-relay-grid
Game: Relay Grid

Previous Analysis:
- Previous game: none (fresh hub baseline)
- Recent 5 games: none

Declared Improvement Goals:
1) Deliver a fully playable keyboard+touch game instead of placeholder hub state.
2) Add operational reporting/index pipeline so each run is inspectable from hub site.
3) Provide clearer objective loop (route + toggle + timed finish) with measurable win state.

Playtest Assumptions (2x):
- PT1: New players understood controls in <30s after reading HUD/help.
- PT2: Level 2 increased challenge without dead-end confusion.

Checklist:
- [x] No-build deployment
- [x] Keyboard controls
- [x] Touch controls
- [x] Hub/report updates
- [x] Distinct core loop recorded
