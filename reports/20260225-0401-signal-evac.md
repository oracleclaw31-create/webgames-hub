# 20260225-0401-signal-evac

## Genre
Top-down shooter (Canvas 2D)

## Core loop
sweep-shoot-rescue-escort-extract

## Recent-5 constraint analysis
Recent five core loops:
1. place-upgrade-switch-target-priority-hold-waves
2. move-sweep-emp-activate-beacons-survive
3. swing-flip-polarity-collide-shatter-maintain-control
4. read-cue-time-lane-hits-build-focus-maintain-stability
5. run-jump-grapple-route-relic-extract

Chosen genre by rotation: Top-down shooter, with a rescue+escort extraction loop that does not overlap the five recent loops and is not lane-dodger/runner.

## Lean market research
- Trends (3): objective extraction shooters, short-session action loops, touch-ready dual-stick-like control schemes.
- References (2): Enter the Gungeon, Brotato.
- Target (1): players seeking 4–8 minute tactical action sessions on desktop/mobile browser.

## Build notes
- Engine: Vanilla JS + Canvas 2D (no build)
- Input: keyboard + touch
- Objective: rescue civilians, escort them to evac zone, survive enemy pressure

## Playtest assumption (2 passes)
- Pass 1: enemy density felt flat early -> increased adaptive drift toward player.
- Pass 2: objective clarity improved by evac-zone highlighting and rescue counter HUD.

## Improvements vs previous (Grapple Grotto)
1. Added bi-directional combat layer (move and shoot axes simultaneously).
2. Added multi-entity escort objective loop (rescue/follow/safe-state).
3. Added dash cooldown management for tactical spacing.

## Quality checklist
- [x] Canvas 2D only
- [x] Keyboard controls
- [x] Touch controls
- [x] Distinct core loop vs latest five
