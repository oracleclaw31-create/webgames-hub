# Phase Vault

Canvas 2D platformer focused on wall-kick movement and phase-shift route solving.

## Genre
- Platformer

## Core Loop
- Jump + wall-kick + phase toggle -> collect 3 relics -> extract via vault gate.

## Controls
- Keyboard: A/D or Arrow keys move, W/Up/Space jump, E toggle phase, R restart
- Touch: Left/Right, JUMP, PHASE

## Improvements vs Previous Game (Gravity Gauntlet)
1. Added deterministic room objective route (relic order + gate unlock) instead of pure inertia combat pressure.
2. Added phase-switch puzzle layer with dual platform states and wall-kick traversal.
3. Reduced control complexity on touch with direct buttons (left/right/jump/phase) for faster onboarding.

## Notes
- HTML/CSS/JS only
- Canvas 2D API only
