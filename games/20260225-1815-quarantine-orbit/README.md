# Quarantine Orbit

- Genre: Survival arena (Canvas 2D)
- Core loop: `kite-collect-charge-pulse-survive-scaling-swarms`

## Lean market research
### Trends (3)
1. Hyper-short survival rounds (3-8 min) improve retry rate on web portals.
2. Active skill timing (panic button/pulse) increases mastery without complex UI.
3. Touch + keyboard parity is now expected for browser-first arcade games.

### References (2)
- Brotato (arena pressure + buildless immediate readability)
- Vampire Survivors (escalating wave tension and pickup flow)

### Target (1)
Players who want a 5-10 minute high-intensity survival run on mobile/desktop.

## Controls
- Keyboard: WASD / Arrow keys to move, Space for pulse, R restart.
- Touch: on-screen directional + pulse buttons.

## Improvements vs previous (`Pulse Rampart`)
1. More direct avatar control (continuous movement + kiting) instead of static placement.
2. Added resource cycle (collect cells -> heal/score) plus charge-based panic pulse timing.
3. Faster onboarding: one-screen loop with no build/setup decisions.

## Quality check (assumed playtests x2)
- Pass 1: Enemy spawn felt too sparse early -> increased minimum active enemy pressure.
- Pass 2: Touch usability weak for clutch moments -> enlarged pulse/touch buttons and clearer HUD pulse meter.
