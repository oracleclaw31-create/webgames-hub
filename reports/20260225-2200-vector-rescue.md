# 20260225-2200-vector-rescue

- Genre: Top-down shooter
- Core loop: move-aim-shoot-rescue-civilians-activate-beacon-extract
- Previous game: 20260225-2104-pulse-parkour (Platformer)

## Lean market research
- Trend 1: Objective-based top-down shooters are outperforming endless-only wave loops in short web sessions.
- Trend 2: Rescue/extract dual objectives increase tension and completion rates.
- Trend 3: Keyboard+touch parity remains critical for portal retention.
- Reference 1: Vampire Survivors (pressure readability).
- Reference 2: Alien Shooter-style browser loops (fast extraction pacing).
- Target: Desktop/mobile players wanting 2~5 minute tactical action runs.

## Improvements vs previous
1. Changed from traversal-only platforming to combat + rescue + extraction objective stack.
2. Added enemy pursuit AI and civilian protection fail-state for higher decision pressure.
3. Added HP/score/beacon progression to make run state legible and strategically meaningful.

## Quality check (assumed playtest x2)
- Pass 1: Enemy pressure ramped too hard early; reduced spawn cadence and capped concurrent enemies.
- Pass 2: Extraction endpoint was unclear; added explicit beacon activation state and HUD guidance.

## Build notes
- Canvas 2D only, no external engine/build step.
- Input parity: keyboard + touch buttons.
