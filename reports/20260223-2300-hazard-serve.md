# Run Report: 20260223-2300-hazard-serve

## Overview
- Title: Hazard Serve
- Genre: Arcade / Brick-breaker
- Platform: Web (Canvas 2D)
- Core loop: charge-angle-serve, chain multiplier optimization, hazard-row survival, wave-clear perk drafting

## What Shipped
- Added a new game at `games/20260223-2300-hazard-serve/` with:
- Charge-hold launch that also sweeps angle before serve release.
- Brick-breaker collision loop with streak-based chain multiplier scoring.
- Periodic hazard-row insertion that shifts brick field downward.
- Between-wave perk panel (keyboard or touch pick) to alter run stats.

## Trends (3)
1. Strong shift toward explicit run-state layering (score, hazard timer, wave phase, perk economy) rather than single-mode play.
2. Increased pressure cadence through timed board mutation (hazard rows) instead of only enemy/ball speed escalation.
3. More cross-input parity: keyboard and touch now mirror the same core interactions, including hold-to-charge behavior.

## Target (1)
1. Reach wave 4 with at least one chain streak of `x8` in a single life.

## Improvements Checklist
- [x] Charge-angle serving integrated and visible with a guide line.
- [x] Chain multiplier scoring loop wired to brick break streak behavior.
- [x] Timed hazard rows implemented with clear HUD timer feedback.
- [x] Between-wave perk selection implemented (3 choices, keyboard + touch).
- [ ] Add SFX and richer impact VFX for paddle/brick/hazard events.
- [ ] Add authored wave patterns for difficulty pacing consistency.

## Deployment Notes
- Included manifest/index/report updates for discoverability.
- Required sanity check target: `node --check games/20260223-2300-hazard-serve/script.js`.
- If remote operations fail (git push / Vercel), local files and report remain updated.
