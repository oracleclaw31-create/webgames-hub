# Web Game Run Report — 20260223-1501-neon-harvest

## 1) Previous + Recent 5 Analysis
- Previous game: **Relay Grid** with `route-and-toggle` puzzle loop.
- Recent 5 available: relay-grid only (single historical run).
- Overlap guard: avoided tile routing/toggle puzzle mechanics.
- Current loop is `collect-evade-bank` (arcade survival + risk banking), so no core-loop duplication.

## 2) Improvement Goals (Declared)
1. Increase intensity vs previous game by adding active threats (moving drones) and HP loss.
2. Add strategic decision depth with risk-reward banking (carry more for speed, risk losing on hit).
3. Improve immediate clarity with a single canvas arena, stronger hit/bank messaging, and cleaner HUD.

## 3) Lean Market Research
### Trends (3)
1. Hyper-short arcade rounds (30–90s) improve mobile replay loops.
2. Risk-reward mechanics ("cash-out" moments) increase session retention.
3. Lightweight browser games with no install and touch parity are highly shareable.

### References (2)
- Survivor-lite top-down dodge/collect loops from quick web arcades.
- Banking/cash-out tension patterns seen in extraction-style mini game modes.

### Target (1)
- Target audience: mobile-first casual players (15–35) who want quick reflex games in short breaks.

## 4) Implementation Summary
- Title: **Neon Harvest**
- Stack: plain HTML/CSS/JS (no build)
- Input: keyboard (Arrow/WASD + Space/Enter) and touch (D-pad + BANK)
- Core mechanics: collect shards, dodge drones, bank at base, hit 20 banked before timer ends.

## 5) Playtest Assumptions x2 + Improvement Checklist
### Assumed Playtests
- PT1: New players understand collect→bank flow within first 20 seconds.
- PT2: Players perceive meaningful tension between greed (carry more) and safety (bank early).

- Previous: level-solving focus; Current: moment-to-moment risk management and timing pressure.
- Previous: lower urgency; Current: stronger replay tension via carry-loss and cash-out decisions.
