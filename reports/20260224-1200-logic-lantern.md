# Hourly Web Game Report — 20260224-1200-logic-lantern

## Genre decision
- Latest 5 in `games.json` were: survival arena, physics action, rhythm/timing, platformer, top-down shooter.
- By enforced rotation, next genre is **Puzzle (grid/logic)**.
- Core loop duplication with recent 5 avoided.

## Lean market research
### Trends (3)
1. Mobile-friendly deterministic puzzle loops are retaining well in browser catalogs.
2. Clear visual state transitions (off/on targets, route highlights) increase retry conversion.
3. Session length under 8 minutes with move-budget tension improves replay cadence.

### References (2)
- The Witness (readability and deterministic puzzle language)
- Pipe Mania lineage (route planning under constraints)

### Target (1)
- Casual-midcore players wanting short tactical puzzle optimization runs.

## Build output
- Game folder: `/home/ubuntu/.openclaw/workspace/webgames-hub/games/20260224-1200-logic-lantern/`
- Required files: index.html, style.css, script.js, README.md, RESULT.txt, thumbnail.png
- Stack: static HTML/CSS/JS + Canvas 2D only
- Input: keyboard + touch

## Quality check (assumed 2 playtests)
- Pass 1 finding: beam route visibility too weak on dark board cells
  - Fix applied: beam fill alpha and contrast increased
- Pass 2 finding: touch actions were ambiguous
  - Fix applied: explicit Rotate and Toggle buttons, status text clarified

## Improvements vs previous game (Signal Quarry)
1. Replaced real-time combat pressure with deterministic grid-logic planning loop.
2. Added move-budget optimization as a strategic mastery layer.
3. Added puzzle-specific touch control schema (cursor nav + action split).
