# Run Report: 20260224-0000-pulse-bastion

## Overview
- Title: Pulse Bastion
- Genre: Tower defense lite (Canvas 2D)
- Core loop: plan-place-upgrade-hold-lane-economy-cycle

## Lean market research
### Trends (3)
1. Hybrid casual-strategy loops with short build phase + short combat phase are retaining mobile/web players.
2. Touch-first but keyboard-parity controls increase session completion on cross-device web play.
3. Lightweight progression (waves + upgrade tiers) outperforms single-mechanic arcade loops for repeat runs.

### References (2)
- *Bloons TD* early-lane readability and upgrade clarity.
- *Kingdom Rush* wave pacing and between-wave planning cadence.

### Target (1)
- 15–30 minute browser players who want tactical decisions without heavy micromanagement.

## Improvements vs previous game (Hazard Serve)
1. Added strategic planning/economy depth (placement, upgrades, sell decisions).
2. Added explicit lane-defense failure pressure with wave scaling and leak-based life loss.
3. Maintained full keyboard + touch control parity for core actions.

## Playtest assumptions (2 passes)
- Pass 1: early waves too easy, credits snowballing quickly.
- Pass 2: adjusted enemy HP/speed scaling and reduced early economy burst to improve tension.

## Improvement checklist
- [x] Unique core loop vs recent 5 entries
- [x] Keyboard + touch actions implemented
- [x] At least 2 concrete improvements vs previous game
- [x] Canvas 2D no-build implementation

## Archive rotation
- Active games count is 17 (<=30), so no archive rotation required this run.

## Delivery status
- Git push: pending attempt in this run
- Vercel deploy: pending attempt in this run
