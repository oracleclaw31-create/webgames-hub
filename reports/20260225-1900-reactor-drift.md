# 20260225-1900-reactor-drift

- Genre: Physics action
- Core loop: charge-tractor-sling-debris-chain-reactor-stabilize
- Previous game: 20260225-1815-quarantine-orbit (Survival arena)

## Lean market research
- Trend 1: Physics-expression action games with short loops are rising on browser hubs.
- Trend 2: Charge-release mechanics improve skill ceiling without heavy tutorials.
- Trend 3: Touch parity with virtual stick/buttons is baseline for web arcade retention.
- Reference 1: Nova Drift (motion readability + control expression).
- Reference 2: Dead Cells training room feel (clear collision feedback and reset loop).
- Target: Mobile/desktop players looking for 3-8 minute, mastery-oriented arcade sessions.

## Improvements vs previous
1. Replaced kite-survive swarm focus with a reactor stabilization objective loop.
2. Added tractor-charge and directional sling for chain reactions and active planning.
3. Added multi-reactor heat balancing, creating tactical prioritization beyond survival.

## Quality check (assumed playtests)
- Playtest 1: Mid-range pull lacked agency → increased charge scaling and visual radius feedback.
- Playtest 2: Meltdown felt too abrupt → introduced stability bonus recovery window and adjusted heat pacing.
