# Gravity Gauntlet (v2)

Canvas 2D physics-action game with improved visual design, onboarding clarity, and touch-first UX.

## Genre
- Physics action

## Core Loop
- Thrust + drift -> ricochet into reactors -> avoid mines -> extract alive.

## Controls
- Keyboard: WASD / Arrow keys move, Space slam, Shift brake, R restart
- Touch: left virtual stick move, right SLAM/BRAKE buttons

## v2 Improvements (Design-focused)
1. **Visual hierarchy upgrade**
   - Refined topbar/title badge/objective block for faster first-read comprehension.
2. **Sci-fi UI polish**
   - Deeper gradients, cleaner contrast, glow accents, stronger panel/button styles.
3. **Onboarding readability**
   - Overlay now uses compact control chips and clearer mission copy.
4. **Mobile UX clarity**
   - Larger virtual stick and action buttons, better spacing and hit targets.

## Notes
- No-build static game (HTML/CSS/JS only)
- Canvas 2D runtime
