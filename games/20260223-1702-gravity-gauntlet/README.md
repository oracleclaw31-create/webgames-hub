# Gravity Gauntlet

Canvas 2D physics action game focused on momentum control and ricochet combat.

## Genre
- Physics action

## Core Loop
- thrust -> drift -> ricochet -> shatter reactors -> clear zone -> extract

## Controls
- Keyboard: WASD / Arrows move, Space slam boost, Shift brake, R restart
- Touch: left joystick + Slam/Brake buttons

## Improvements vs Previous (Rift Scrappers)
1. Reactor-objective mission structure with clear extraction win condition.
2. Physics-heavy ricochet risk/reward (slam + brake) instead of survival kiting only.
3. Simpler, always-visible HUD and fail states for faster onboarding.

## Lean Market Notes
- Trends: short-session challenge loops, tactile physics feedback, mobile-friendly dual-action controls.
- References: Geometry Arena-style inertia combat feel, classic Asteroids momentum readability.
- Target: players wanting 2-4 minute high-skill browser action sessions.
