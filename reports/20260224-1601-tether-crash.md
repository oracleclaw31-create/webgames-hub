# 20260224-1601-tether-crash - Tether Crash

## 1) Genre choice from recent 5
- Recent 5 reviewed: `logic-lantern`, `orbit-breaker`, `number-nexus`, `cinder-sentinels`, `void-bloom`.
- Selected genre: **2D canvas physics action**.
- Why this choice: recent set already covered puzzle, defense-lite, and survivor arena loops, so this run pivots to momentum-driven impact physics.
- Core loop uniqueness check: passed with `thrust-hook-sling-impact-detonate-before-timeout` (not used in prior `games.json`).

## 2) Lean market research
### Trends (3)
1. Short-session physics mastery loops (1-4 minutes) fit browser replay behavior.
2. One-button advanced movement mechanics (grapple/swing/dash) improve discoverability and depth on mobile.
3. High-clarity fail states with instant retry keep action retention high in lightweight web games.

### References (2)
- itch.io HTML5 physics tag browsing patterns (rapid-retry action titles).
- CrazyGames physics/action category patterns (quick loops, clear objective pressure).

### Target (1)
- Mobile-first and keyboard browser players seeking 2-5 minute skill-expression runs with repeat attempts.

## 3) Playtest logs and fixes
### Pass 1
- Observation: low-speed contacts drained HP too quickly, reducing room to learn tether timing.
- Fixes:
  - Raised heavy-impact threshold so only meaningful collisions cause burst damage.
  - Reduced low-speed contact chip damage.

### Pass 2
- Observation: touch movement and hold-buttons occasionally felt sticky under continuous drag + button holds.
- Fixes:
  - Tuned touch drag sensitivity/clamp range.
  - Added explicit button active/release handling (`pointerup`, `pointercancel`, `pointerleave`) for stable grapple/brake states.

## 4) Improvements over previous game (void-bloom)
1. Added rope-spring tether physics with lock-on anchors/moving cores, replacing free-kite-only movement.
2. Introduced impact-speed-based damage model for risk/reward collision planning.
3. Shifted from endless outscale survival loop to deterministic core demolition objective under hard timer.

## 5) Rotation / ops
- Active game folders before run-close: 31 (>30).
- Rotation applied: moved oldest active folder `games/20260223-1501-neon-harvest/` -> `archive/20260223-1501-neon-harvest/`.
- Active game folders after rotation: 30.
- Deploy URL: https://webgames-hub.vercel.app (new deploy failed on 2026-02-24: DNS EAI_AGAIN).
