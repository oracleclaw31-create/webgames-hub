# Ember Brick

- Genre: Brick-breaker, Canvas 2D
- Core loop: steer-deflect-charge-overdrive-break-sectors

## Controls
- Keyboard: `A/D` or `Left/Right` move, `Space/Enter` launch/pulse, `C` prime catch, `R` restart
- Touch: Left, Right, Launch/Pulse, Catch, Restart buttons

## Improvements vs previous (`20260225-0500-circuit-shift`)
1. Replaces deterministic grid puzzle pacing with real-time rebound skill expression and combo pressure.
2. Adds an overdrive timing layer (charge meter, temporary widened paddle, ember-brick pierce) for tactical burst windows.
3. Adds catch-and-relaunch control for shot planning, improving recovery agency on both keyboard and touch.
