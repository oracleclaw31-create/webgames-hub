Game: Reactor Rhythm
ID: 20260225-0201-reactor-rhythm
Genre: Rhythm/timing (Canvas 2D)
Core loop: read-cue-time-lane-hits-build-focus-maintain-stability

Playtest pass 1 (assumed)
- [x] Keyboard hits (A/S/K/L), focus trigger (Space), restart (Enter) all respond correctly
- [x] Note spawn, judgment windows (Perfect/Good/Miss), combo, and stability drain verified
- [x] End states (clear/fail) and restart prompt render correctly

Playtest pass 2 (assumed)
- [x] Touch lane buttons and focus button map with keyboard parity
- [x] Mobile-width layout keeps controls readable and tappable
- [x] Focus window visibility and HUD feedback improved for readability

Fixes after playtest
- Tightened missed-note drain to avoid abrupt fail snowball on a single mistake chain
- Increased lane flash contrast during touch input to improve timing feedback

Previous vs Current Improvements
- Polarity Pendulum 대비 (1) 물리 충돌 숙련에서 박자 판정 중심의 명시적 타이밍 루프로 전환
- Polarity Pendulum 대비 (2) Focus 자원(게이지 소비) 기반 판정 완화/사용 타이밍 의사결정층 추가
- Polarity Pendulum 대비 (3) 레인별 입력 피드백 강화로 키보드/터치 판독성을 개선

Previous vs Current Improvements: explicit beat-judgment scoring + Focus meter tactical timing + stronger touch lane feedback clarity
