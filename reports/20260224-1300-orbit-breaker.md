# 20260224-1300-orbit-breaker — Orbit Breaker

## 1) Genre rotation decision
- Recent 5 analyzed from `games.json`: kinetic-smash, beatline-bastion, vaultbound-climb, signal-quarry, logic-lantern.
- Selected genre by priority cycle and overlap avoidance: **Brick-breaker (#4)**.
- Core loop duplication check: **passed**.
- Lane-dodger/runner continuity check: **passed**.

## 2) Lean market research
### Trends (3)
1. Fast retry arcade loops remain high-performing in web game hubs.
2. A single active ability in brick-breaker variants increases replay depth.
3. Touch+keyboard parity reduces drop-off between desktop and mobile.

### References (2)
- Arkanoid (trajectory readability)
- Shatter (ability-enhanced brick control)

### Target (1)
- 3–7 minute session players who enjoy skillful rebound mastery.

## 3) Build summary
- Canvas 2D only, no build system.
- Inputs: keyboard (A/D, ←/→, Space, Shift) + touch buttons (Left/Right/Launch/Pulse).
- Core loop: `deflect-pulse-break-chain-clear-stage`.

## 4) Quality check (assumed 2 playtests)
- Pass 1: keyboard movement and launch pacing validated; rebound visibility tuned.
- Pass 2: touch hold behavior validated; pulse cooldown feedback clarified.

### Improvement checklist vs previous (Logic Lantern)
- [x] Real-time reflex loop replacing deterministic turn puzzle loop.
- [x] Added active Pulse skill-timing mechanic.
- [x] Added combo + stage pressure progression.

## 5) Hub update
- Updated `games.json`, root `index.html`, `reports/index.html`, `reports/latest.md`, and `README.md`.
- Active game count remains <= 30; archive rotation not required.

## 6) Deployment
- Target: Vercel project `webgames-hub`.
