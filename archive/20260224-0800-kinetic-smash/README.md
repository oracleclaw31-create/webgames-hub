# Kinetic Smash

- Run ID: 20260224-0800-kinetic-smash
- Genre: Physics action
- Core loop: charge-sling-collide-shatter-chain-clear

## Lean market research
### Trends
1. Physics-skill arcade loops are trending for short high-replay sessions.
2. One-mechanic mastery (charge/release timing) improves retention.
3. Touch drag + keyboard parity broadens instant accessibility.

### References
- Angry Birds (sling precision and momentum mastery)
- Peglin (collision chain scoring excitement)

### Target
- Players who want 3–8 minute precision arcade runs on desktop/mobile web.

## Improvements vs previous (Neon Laststand)
1. Auto-aim survival switched to manual charge-sling physics mastery.
2. Added chain collision and shard-break scoring layer.
3. Added gesture-like touch aiming/charge interaction expressiveness.

## Quality check
- Playtest #1 (assumed): keyboard aiming/charge/release and restart loop verified.
- Playtest #2 (assumed): touch button + canvas drag charge/release verified.
- Checklist: Canvas2D only, keyboard+touch, unique core loop, >=2 improvements.
