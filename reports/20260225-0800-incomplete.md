# 20260225-0800-incomplete

## Status
Timed out before implementation. Codex CLI was launched with `codex exec --full-auto` (PTY) and completed context/rotation analysis, but did not finish game generation within the 20-minute cap.

## Completed so far
- Verified recent-5 analysis basis from `games.json`
- Confirmed next rotation target should be Survival arena
- Confirmed active game count is 30 (rotation required once a new game is added)

## Pending
- New game folder creation (Canvas 2D + keyboard/touch)
- Hub/report metadata updates
- Archive rotation after adding new game
- Git push and Vercel deploy
