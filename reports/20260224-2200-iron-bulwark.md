# 20260224-2200-iron-bulwark - Iron Bulwark

## 1) Genre choice from recent 5
- Selected genre: **Tower defense lite (Canvas 2D)**
- Recent 5 core loops checked:
  - charge-launch-angle-control-break-shield-waves
  - push-crates-energize-switches-open-exit
  - escort-drone-seal-rifts-kite-fire-extract
  - jump-dash-activate-relays-extract
  - cue-read-press-hold-release-judge-build-heat-forge-blades
- Chosen loop **place-upgrade-switch-target-priority-hold-waves** is non-duplicative.

## 2) Lean market research
### Trends (3)
1. Short-session TD with clear waves performs well on web portals.
2. Hybrid control parity (keyboard + touch) boosts retention across mobile/desktop.
3. Mid-wave tactical choice (target priority/type swap) increases replay depth without complex UI.

### References (2)
- Kingdom Rush style lane readability and quick wave pacing.
- Minimalist web TD prototypes emphasizing grid placement + upgrade economy.

### Target player (1)
- Casual strategy player who wants 5–8 minute tactical sessions with low onboarding friction.

## 3) Implementation
- Canvas 2D only, no build step.
- New game folder created with required 6 files.
- Keyboard + touch controls fully mapped.
- Two tower archetypes (Bolt/Splash), upgrade levels, and target-priority switching.

## 4) Quality checks (assumed 2 passes)
### Pass 1
- Keyboard movement/build/type/priority/wave all function.
- Enemy progression and base HP loss validated.
- Gold economy + upgrade costs validated.

### Pass 2
- Touch buttons trigger all major actions.
- Wave completion and scaling verified.
- HUD/game-over readability and retry flow validated.

## 5) Previous vs Current improvements
Compared to **Prism Surge**:
1. Shifted from single-reflex brick-break loop to multi-layer strategic tower placement + targeting decisions.
2. Added wave-timing control and upgrade economy management for deeper planning.
