# Run Report: 20260224-0300-ion-drift-siege

## Overview
- Genre: Top-down shooter
- Core loop: kite enemies -> shoot -> capture uplinks -> survive wave
- Selection reason: Recent 5 already include platformer/puzzle/brick-breaker/tower-defense flavors, so rotation advanced to top-down shooter while avoiding loop overlap.

## Lean market research
### Trends (3)
1. Short-session arena shooters with explicit sub-objectives improve retention over pure endless survival.
2. Mobile web players prefer visible action buttons over gesture-only combat input.
3. Wave-based escalation with readable telegraphing outperforms opaque difficulty spikes.

### References (2)
- Brotato: compact wave pressure and readable enemy density pacing.
- Vampire Survivors (early loop): fast reset/retry and escalating crowd management.

### Target audience (1)
- Players wanting 3–8 minute high-intensity browser sessions with immediate restart value.

## Improvements vs previous
1. Added ranged combat and enemy pursuit AI (new tactical spacing loop).
2. Added objective stacking (capture uplinks + clear wave) for more depth.

## Playtest checklist (assumed x2)
