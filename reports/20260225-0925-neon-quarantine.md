## Lean market research
### Trends (3)
1. Session-complete runs in 3-6 minutes with immediate restart hooks.
2. Hybrid desktop/mobile controls with low onboarding friction.
3. Arena readability improvements (clean telegraphs + concise HUD) in micro-browser games.

### References (2)
- Brotato
- Vampire Survivors

### Target (1)
Action players wanting short high-replay sessions during breaks (desktop + mobile browser).

## Previous vs current improvements (vs Turret Tide)
1. Shifted from strategic grid placement to direct avatar control with kiting + burst dash timing.
2. Added node-charge objective and pulse economy for layered resource decisions.
3. Upgraded touch accessibility with dedicated directional/action buttons.

## Quality checks
- Playtest pass 1: spawn pressure jumped too fast at start -> early spawn curve reduced.
- Playtest pass 2: pulse over-centralized combat -> energy cost raised and effect tuned.
