# Run Report: 20260224-1103-signal-quarry

## Overview
- Genre: Top-down shooter (Canvas 2D)
- Core loop: strafe-burst-secure-relays-extract
- Rotation decision: previous run was Platformer, so rotated to Top-down shooter per mandated cycle while avoiding recent 5 loop overlap.

## Lean market research
### Trends (3)
1. Arena shooters with objective capture are rising in web portal featured slots.
2. Fast-fail / fast-retry sessions under 6 minutes increase replay and shareability.
3. Clear touch overlays remain critical for mobile browser conversion.

### References (2)
- Assault Android Cactus (readable enemy swarms + pressure pacing)
- Crimsonland (compact survival-shooter combat loop)

### Target (1)
- Desktop/mobile players seeking short tactical shooter runs with immediate retries.

## Improvements vs previous (Vaultbound Climb)
1. Shifted from jump-route platform precision to free-angle movement + burst aiming combat.
2. Added multi-objective relay capture layer with enemy disruption pressure, not just loot-and-extract.
3. Improved touch parity with explicit directional cluster + dedicated burst button.

## Quality check
- Playtest pass 1 (assumed): relay capture pacing was too safe in early 20s; increased enemy move speed scaling.
- Playtest pass 2 (assumed): touch burst reliability improved by adding dedicated button and pointer-tap fire.

### Checklist
- [x] Canvas 2D rendering only
- [x] Keyboard controls (WASD/Arrows + Space)
- [x] Touch controls (4-way + burst)
- [x] No build step
- [x] Distinct core loop vs recent 5
