# Void Bloom

- Genre: Survival arena (Canvas 2D)
- Core loop: kite-autofire-dash-pick-perk-outscale-waves
- Controls: Keyboard (WASD/Arrows + Space + Enter) and Touch (drag move + DASH/PICK)

## Improvements vs previous (Cinder Sentinels)
1. Static tower placement loop -> direct avatar kiting + dash mobility skill expression.
2. Added auto-fire target pressure with on-run perk drafting for mid-run adaptation.
3. Stronger touch parity via drag movement plus dedicated action buttons.

## Balancing notes
- Waves ramp each ~12s.
- Dash cooldown 2.2s; fire-rate perks cap at safety floor.
