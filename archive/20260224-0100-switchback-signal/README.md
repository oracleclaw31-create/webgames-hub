# Switchback Signal

Switchback Signal is a Canvas 2D platformer focused on momentum movement, relay activation, and fast extraction routing.

## Controls
- Keyboard: `A/D` or arrows move, `Space` / `W` / `Up` jump, `Shift` dash, `E` activate relays, `R` restart.
- Touch: press `Left`/`Right` to move, tap `Jump`, tap `Dash`, hold `Activate` near a relay (or tap after clear to restart).

## Core Loop
- Traverse a side-scrolling route while avoiding spikes, patrol drones, and crumbling platforms.
- Stabilize all 3 relays by staying in range and holding activate.
- Use dash + jump timing to reach the open exit hatch quickly for a better medal.

## Improvements vs Previous Game (Pulse Bastion)
- Added full avatar physics platforming with coyote time and jump buffering for cleaner control precision.
- Added dynamic traversal hazards (patrol drones + crumble platforms) instead of static lane defense flow.
- Added speedrun-style completion feedback (time + medal) to support replay-driven mastery.
