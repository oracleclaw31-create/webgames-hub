- Genre: Tower defense lite
- Core loop: place-synergize-pulse-defend-upgrade-through-waves
- Previous game: Reactor Ricochet (Brick-breaker)

## Lean market research
- Trend 1: Short-session strategy loops with immediate readability perform well on web portals.
- Trend 2: Hybrid action+defense systems (active skills + passive towers) improve retention.
- Trend 3: Mobile-first touch parity is expected for browser games.
- Reference 1: Kingdom Rush-style lane readability and wave cadence.
- Reference 2: Isle of Arrows-style compact placement decisions and synergy.
- Target: 10–20 minute tactical players who enjoy quick retries and escalating pressure.

## Improvements vs previous
1. Switched from paddle ricochet reflex play to macro placement strategy + economy.
2. Added active EMP skill timing layer on top of passive turret DPS.
3. Improved touch parity with direct tap placement while keeping keyboard hotkeys.

## Quality check (assumed playtests)
- Pass 1: Wave pacing adjusted (spawn scaling up, starting gold reduced).
- Pass 2: EMP feedback improved (radius effect + longer slow).
