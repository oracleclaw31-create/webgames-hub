# 20260225-0100 - Incomplete Run

This run did not complete within the execution window.

## Status
- Codex CLI was invoked with `codex exec --full-auto` (PTY) multiple times.
- Repository inspection and constraint analysis were performed.
- Partial game scaffold was created then removed to avoid inconsistent state.
- No new game was finalized; no hub metadata was changed.
- No git push or Vercel deployment was performed.

## Reason
- Codex sessions repeatedly stalled during generation flow and did not reach completion.

## Next action
- Retry next run with a tighter single-shot Codex prompt and explicit write-only steps.
