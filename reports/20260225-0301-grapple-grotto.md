# 20260225-0301-grapple-grotto

## Genre
Platformer (Canvas 2D)

## Core loop
run-jump-grapple-route-relic-extract

## Recent-5 constraint analysis
Recent five core loops:
1. charge-launch-angle-control-break-shield-waves
2. place-upgrade-switch-target-priority-hold-waves
3. move-sweep-emp-activate-beacons-survive
4. swing-flip-polarity-collide-shatter-maintain-control
5. read-cue-time-lane-hits-build-focus-maintain-stability

Chosen genre by rotation: Platformer (after Rhythm/timing), with non-overlapping traversal loop and no lane-dodger/runner pattern.

## Lean market research
- Trends (3): short-session precision platformers, grapple/hook mobility mechanics, mobile touch-parity browser games.
- References (2): Celeste (tight retry readability), Grapple Dog (hook traversal clarity).
- Target (1): players seeking 3–6 minute movement-mastery sessions.

## Previous vs Current improvements (>=2)
Compared with 20260225-0201-reactor-rhythm:
1. Shifted from lane timing judgments to free spatial traversal and route optimization.
2. Added grapple-pull mobility as a second mastery axis beyond jump timing.
3. Added platform physics risk management (landing/fall recovery) instead of rhythm-only hit windows.

## QA (assumed playtest x2)
- Pass 1: movement felt slippery → increased horizontal damping and acceleration balance.
- Pass 2: grapple utility was unclear → added dedicated touch button and stronger pull factor.
- Checklist: Canvas 2D only ✅ / Keyboard ✅ / Touch ✅ / Restart flow ✅ / Win condition ✅
