## 3) Lean Market Research
### Trends (3)
1. Browser sessions are increasingly short and replay-focused, favoring immediate combat loops.
2. Dual-stick-inspired top-down control patterns are now expected even in lightweight web games.
3. Clear objective layering (survive + complete mission objective) improves retention over pure score-chase.

### References (2)
- Brotato (arena pressure and compact wave readability).
- 20 Minutes Till Dawn (short-run escalation and clarity-first projectile combat).

### Target (1)
- Target: players who want 3–8 minute action runs on desktop/mobile browsers with clear mastery progression.

## 4) Implementation Summary

- Playtest pass 2 (assumed): touch buttons and HUD readability validated on mobile viewport.
- Improvement checklist: satisfied with 2+ concrete upgrades vs prior game.
