Genre: Puzzle (grid/logic)
Core loop: inspect-route-rotate-power-all-terminals-before-move-limit

Previous vs Current improvements:
- Added deterministic multi-level mission progression (3 escalating boards) instead of a single traversal objective.
- Added strategic planning pressure through visible move budget and tile-rotation economy.
- Added direct tile tap-rotate interaction on top of button controls for faster mobile puzzle play.

Controls:
- Keyboard: Arrow keys/WASD move cursor, Space/R rotate, Enter continue, Esc restart level.
- Touch: Tap tile to select/rotate, or use Up/Down/Left/Right, Rotate, Restart buttons.

Known limitations:
- Uses authored puzzle layouts with shuffled rotations, so board topology is not fully procedural.
- No undo stack; mistaken rotations cost moves.
- Audio and haptic feedback are not implemented.
