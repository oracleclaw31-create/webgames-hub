Genre: Rhythm timing (Canvas 2D)

Playtest pass 1 assumptions:
- Players understand TAP/HOLD/RELEASE ordering from right-panel pattern list.
- First-minute difficulty should feel learnable at ~650ms beat pace.

Playtest pass 1 checklist:
- [x] TAP judgment triggers only inside timing window.
- [x] HOLD start requires on-beat press.
- [x] RELEASE evaluates both release timing and hold duration.
- [x] Miss feedback clearly indicates reason.

Playtest pass 2 assumptions:
- Touch hold/release is stable while dragging/pressing with one finger.
- Players can recover after misses due to moderate integrity loss and restart access.

Playtest pass 2 checklist:
- [x] Pointer up/cancel/leave all release hold state.
- [x] Keyboard and touch have parity for press/hold/release loop.
- [x] Combo and score visibly respond to timing quality tiers.
- [x] Restart path works from fail state.

Improvement summary vs 20260224-1601-tether-crash:
- Added deterministic rhythm judgment loop with hold-release windows.
- Added pattern-memory sequencing instead of free physics routing.
- Added heat/integrity dual-pressure progression model.
