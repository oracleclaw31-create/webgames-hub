Run: 20260224-1700-tempo-forge
Genre: Rhythm/timing
Core loop: hold-charge-release-on-beat-forge-chain
Playtest pass 1 (assumed): Perfect window felt too strict; widened perfect timing threshold and improved feedback text visibility.
Playtest pass 2 (assumed): Touch hold/release misfires reduced with separate HOLD and RELEASE buttons and lower accidental overheat penalty.
Improvement checklist:
- [x] 2D Canvas-only implementation
- [x] Keyboard + touch parity
- [x] >=2 improvements vs previous game
- [x] Core loop differs from recent 5
- [x] Non lane-dodger/runner family
Known issues: no audio metronome, single arena background.
Status: Built and integrated.
