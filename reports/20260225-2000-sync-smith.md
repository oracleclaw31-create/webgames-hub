- Genre: Rhythm/timing
- Core loop: rotate-align-hit-on-beat-forge-segments-complete-song
- Previous game: 20260225-1900-reactor-drift (Physics action)

## Lean market research
- Trend 1: Browser rhythm games with 60-90 second runs are seeing higher completion rates.
- Trend 2: Hybrid timing+positioning mechanics increase mastery depth without extra controls.
- Trend 3: Touch-first button layouts are now baseline for short-session web retention.
- Reference 1: A Dance of Fire and Ice (strict timing cadence).
- Reference 2: Rhythm Doctor (single-action judgement readability).
- Target: Desktop/mobile players seeking short high-skill rhythm loops.

## Improvements vs previous
1. Shifted from physics sling/reactor management to precision beat-alignment forging loop.
2. Added explicit perfect/miss timing windows with combo-centric feedback readability.
3. Simplified touch UX to three primary actions (left/hit/right) for faster mobile onboarding.

## Quality check (assumed playtest x2)
- Playtest #1: Timing window felt too harsh → widened hit tolerance slightly.
- Playtest #2: Touch taps occasionally missed during pulse moments → enlarged buttons and active feedback.
- Checklist: canvas-only ✅ keyboard ✅ touch ✅ 2+ improvements ✅ recent-5 core loop overlap 없음 ✅
