# Grapple Grotto

- Genre: Platformer (Canvas 2D)
- Core loop: run-jump-grapple-route-relic-extract

## Controls
- Keyboard: Arrow Left/Right move, Z jump, X grapple pull, R restart
- Touch: Left/Right/Jump/Grapple buttons

## Lean market research
- Trends (3): short-session precision platformers, mobility-skill mechanics (grapple/hook), touch-parity browser play.
- References (2): Celeste (tight retry loop), Grapple Dog (hook movement readability).
- Target (1): players who want 3–6 minute mastery runs with movement tech.

## Improvements vs previous (Reactor Rhythm)
1. Switched from lane-timing rhythm to spatial traversal with multi-platform route planning.
2. Added grapple-assisted mobility layer with risk/reward recovery from mistimed jumps.
3. Added physics platform handling (ground detection/fall recovery) instead of hit-window timing only.
