# 20260224-1700-tempo-forge - Tempo Forge

## 1) Genre choice from recent 5
- Recent 5 reviewed: `1200-logic-lantern`, `1300-orbit-breaker`, `1315-number-nexus`, `1400-cinder-sentinels`, `1510-void-bloom`.
- Selected genre: **rhythm timing forge (Canvas 2D)**.
- Core loop uniqueness check: `cue-read-press-hold-release-judge-build-heat-forge-blades` is not duplicated in recent entries and is not lane-dodger/runner.

## 2) Lean market research
### Trends (3)
1. Fast retry rhythm score-chasers perform well in lightweight browser sessions.
2. Mixed input verbs (tap + hold + release) increase depth without complex controls.
3. Judgment-tier feedback plus visible combo scaling strengthens replay motivation.

### References (2)
- itch.io HTML5 rhythm tag browsing patterns.
- CrazyGames rhythm/music category patterns.

### Target persona (1)
- Browser player (mobile+keyboard capable) who wants short mastery loops with measurable timing improvement.

## 3) Playtest pass logs
### Pass 1 assumptions
- Players can parse step labels and understand when to hold vs release.
- Initial BPM gives enough read time before pressure ramps.

### Pass 1 checklist
- [x] Tap timing judgment aligned to beat ring and window text.
- [x] Hold steps require on-time activation.
- [x] Release step checks both hold duration and release beat.
- [x] Failure reasons are explicit.

### Pass 2 assumptions
- Touch and keyboard should feel equivalent for continuous hold/release actions.
- Failing a few notes should be recoverable before full break.

### Pass 2 checklist
- [x] Pointer up/cancel/leave events cleanly release hold state.
- [x] Space key down/up parity with touch press/release.
- [x] Combo + judgment tiers produce visible scoring differences.
- [x] Restart flow resets phrase, tempo, and meters.

## 4) Improvements over previous game (20260224-1601-tether-crash)
1. Replaced tether-physics impact loop with deterministic rhythm timing windows (tap/hold/release).
2. Added authored pattern-sequence memory layer, creating planned execution rather than freeform collision routes.
3. Added dual-pressure resource model (`heat` decay + `integrity`) instead of primarily timer-bound demolition pacing.
