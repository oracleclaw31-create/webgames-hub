Core loop: run-jump-grapple-tag-extract

Quality check (assumed 2 playtest passes)

Improvement checklist vs previous game (Signal Breach)
- [x] Increased traversal depth with grapple-assisted movement and vertical route planning.
- [x] Introduced deterministic objective gating (3 tagged beacons -> extract gate) with explicit mission status HUD.
