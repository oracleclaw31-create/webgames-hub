## Lean market research
### Trends (3)
1. Vertical precision platformers continue to perform as repeatable short-session browser content.
2. Risk-reward extraction loops (collect then escape) increase replay intent over single-goal runs.
3. Touch-button parity with keyboard remains key for mobile completion in web arcade funnels.

### References (2)
- Celeste Classic (tight climb/jump readability)
- Spelunky Classic (collect-and-extract pressure loop)

### Target (1)
- Desktop/mobile players who want 2~5 minute high-focus platform runs with quick retry.

## Improvements vs previous (Beatline Bastion)
1. Replaces lane rhythm timing with freeform vertical movement and route optimization.
2. Adds stealth-pressure guard patrol penalties and extraction gating via shard collection.
3. Improves touch accessibility with four explicit movement buttons including drop-through control.
