## Genre
Platformer, Canvas 2D

## Core loop
`wall-jump-hook-switch-gate-extract`

## Recent-5 duplication check
Recent five loops checked:
- dash-kite-charge-nodes-release-shockwave-survive
- place-upgrade-defend-earn-scale
- push-rotate-route-power-core-exit
- sweep-shoot-rescue-escort-extract
- run-jump-grapple-route-relic-extract

Result: no duplicate loop; not lane-dodger/runner.

## Lean market research
### Trends (3)
1. Precision platform mini-runs with fast retries are climbing on web portals.
2. Mobility verbs (hook/dash/wall-jump) increase retention in short sessions.
3. Touch parity with simple on-screen buttons is now baseline for mobile web games.

### Target (1)
Desktop/mobile players (15–34) seeking 2–5 minute high-skill movement challenges.

## Previous vs Current improvements
Compared to Neon Quarantine:
1. Arena survival loop replaced by structured platform puzzle progression with gated objective.
2. Added dual switch dependency before exit unlock (clear objective layering).
3. Added hook-burst + drop-through platform control depth for both keyboard and touch.

## Quality checks
- Playtest pass 1 (assumed): hook momentum felt weak -> increased attraction coefficient.
- Playtest pass 2 (assumed): exit reached too early -> enforced 2-switch gate lock.
