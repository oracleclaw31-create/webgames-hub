## Genre
Puzzle (grid/logic), Canvas 2D

## Core loop
push-rotate-route-power-core-exit

## Recent-5 constraint analysis
Recent five loops:
1. move-sweep-emp-activate-beacons-survive
2. swing-flip-polarity-collide-shatter-maintain-control
3. read-cue-time-lane-hits-build-focus-maintain-stability
4. run-jump-grapple-route-relic-extract
5. sweep-shoot-rescue-escort-extract

New loop is deterministic route planning + node rotation puzzle, non-duplicate and not lane-dodger/runner.

## Lean market research
- Trends (3): short-session logic puzzles, mobile-first touch UI, low-stress strategic gameplay.
- References (2): Baba Is You (rule-driven puzzle readability), Pipe Mania (route optimization pressure).
- Target (1): 18-34 players who want 2-5 minute cerebral runs between tasks.

## Quality check (assumed 2 playtests)
- Pass 1: verified keyboard + touch parity, objective comprehension, win/fail messaging.
- Pass 2: tuned readability and move counter clarity; confirmed undo/reset reliability.

Checklist:
- [x] Canvas 2D only
- [x] Keyboard controls
- [x] Touch controls
- [x] 2+ improvements vs previous
- [x] Recent-5 core loop non-duplicate
