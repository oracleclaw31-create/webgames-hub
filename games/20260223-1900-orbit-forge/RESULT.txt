Run ID: 20260223-1900-orbit-forge
Genre: Top-down shooter
Core loop: orbit-charge-discharge-overload

Previous vs Current Improvements (vs 20260223-1822-phase-vault):
1) Dual-resource combat pacing (energy budget for both firing and boosting) adds tactical timing beyond platform traversal.
2) Objective pressure layering (enemy swarms pathing to relay cores + core overload race) introduces simultaneous threat and mission management.
3) Short-loop readability upgrade with explicit HUD loop status and on-screen touch action cluster.

Playtest Assumption (2 passes):
- Pass 1: confirmed keyboard controls, projectile collisions, wave progression, and retryability.
- Pass 2: confirmed touch buttons for movement/fire/boost and HUD state visibility on mobile viewport.

Checklist:
- [x] Canvas 2D only
- [x] Keyboard controls
- [x] Touch controls
- [x] No build step
- [x] Core loop non-duplicate vs recent 5
- [x] Non runner/lane-dodger sequence
