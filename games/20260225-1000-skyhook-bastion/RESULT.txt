Run status: completed
Playtest pass 1 (assumed): Hook pull was too weak on touch -> increased hook acceleration and nearest-hook snap.
Playtest pass 2 (assumed): Exit was reachable before puzzle completion -> added 2-switch gate dependency.
Improvement checklist:
- [x] Canvas 2D only
- [x] Keyboard + touch controls
- [x] >=2 improvements vs previous game
- [x] Distinct core loop vs recent 5
- [x] Non lane-dodger/runner continuity
