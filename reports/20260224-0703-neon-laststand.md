# Run Report: 20260224-0703-neon-laststand

## Overview
- Genre: Survival arena
- Core loop: kite -> dash -> auto-aim shots -> survive escalating waves -> recover HP between waves
- Selection reason: Followed rotation after tower-defense-lite and avoided overlap with recent five core loops.

## Last 5 analysis
- tower defense lite / brick-breaker / rhythm-puzzle / top-down shooter / platformer were already represented.
- Current loop is non-runner and non-lane-dodger.

## Lean market research
### Trends (3)
1. 3-5 minute survival sessions retain mobile/desktop users.
2. One-button attack + movement lowers onboarding friction.
3. Escalating wave tempo improves replayability.

### References (2)
- Vampire Survivors (arena pressure pacing)
- Brotato (compact wave survival readability)

### Target audience (1)
- Casual-midcore players wanting short, replayable action rounds on web.

## Improvements vs previous (Overclock Outpost)
1. Shifted from planning-heavy defense to high-tempo direct control survival loop.
2. Added dash burst mechanic for skill expression and clutch escapes.
3. Simplified touch flow with hold movement + dedicated shoot/dash actions.

## Playtest
- Round 1: keyboard controls, wave progression, game-over/restart verified.
- Round 2: touch buttons hold behavior and combat readability verified.
