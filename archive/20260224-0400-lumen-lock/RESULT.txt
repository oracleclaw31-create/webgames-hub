Result: COMPLETE
Genre: Rhythm/timing puzzle (Canvas 2D)
Core loop: scan target -> navigate cursor -> timed cross-toggle -> clear pattern -> gain time -> harder pattern

Playtest assumption
- Pass 1: keyboard navigation/toggle and level progression verified
- Pass 2: touch cell tapping + on-screen button restart verified

Improvements vs previous game (Ion Drift Siege)
1) Added deterministic logic challenge with visible target-state matching (higher strategic readability).
2) Added precision timing pressure via shrinking timer + bonus-time clear rewards.
3) Added direct board-touch interaction and full keyboard/touch parity.
