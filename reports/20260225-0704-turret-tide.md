## Genre
Tower defense lite, Canvas 2D

## Core loop
place-upgrade-defend-earn-scale

## Recent-5 constraint analysis
Recent five loops before this run:
1. read-cue-time-lane-hits-build-focus-maintain-stability
2. run-jump-grapple-route-relic-extract
3. sweep-shoot-rescue-escort-extract
4. push-rotate-route-power-core-exit
5. steer-deflect-charge-overdrive-break-sectors

Why non-duplicate:
- New loop is lane path defense with build/upgrade economy, distinct from rhythm/platform/shooter/puzzle/brick-breaker loops.
- Not a lane-dodger/runner family.

## Lean market research
- Trends (3): short-session strategy loops, hybrid arcade+meta progression, touch-first tactical UX.
- References (2): Mini TD mobile sessions, desktop desktop-lite tower defense flash classics.
- Target (1): players wanting 5-8 minute strategic runs with simple controls.

## Quality check (assumed)
- Playtest #1: wave 1-3 pacing was too soft -> enemy HP scaling increased.
- Playtest #2: economy was too restrictive -> kill reward and wave bonus increased.
- Improvement checklist:
  - [x] Strategic placement/upgrade depth added vs previous game.
  - [x] Wave pacing + resource management layer added.
  - [x] Keyboard/touch parity for cursor + action buttons.
