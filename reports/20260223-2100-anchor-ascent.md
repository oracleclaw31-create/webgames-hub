# Web Game Run Report - 20260223-2100-anchor-ascent

## 1) Genre
- Platformer

## 2) Recent 5 Analysis
- 20260223-1601 rift-scrappers: kite-dash-scrap-pulse-upgrade-survive
- 20260223-1702 gravity-gauntlet: thrust-drift-ricochet-shatter-reactor-clear-extract
- 20260223-1822 phase-vault: jump-wallkick-phase-toggle-relic-extract
- 20260223-1900 orbit-forge: orbit-charge-discharge-overload
- 20260223-2000 signal-breach: strafe-mark-detonate-hack-extract
- Rotation decision: picked Platformer (priority #1) with a non-duplicate core loop.
- New core loop: run-jump-grapple-tag-extract (distinct from recent five).
- Lane-dodger/runner continuity: avoided.

## 3) Lean Market Research
### Trends (3)
1. Fast-retry precision platformers remain strong for short web sessions when death feedback is immediate and objective clarity is high.
2. Grapple or mobility-ability verbs increase retention by adding route-expression depth without requiring large content scope.
3. Mobile web engagement improves when touch controls map to clear discrete actions (move/jump/ability) rather than gesture-only input.

### References (2)
1. Celeste-style authored room readability and retry pacing.
2. Grapple Hook platformer microgames that center one cooldown ability for traversal expression.

### Target (1)
- "10-minute mastery chaser": player who wants compact but skill-expressive runs with clear completion criteria.

## 4) Quality Check
### Playtest assumption (2 passes)
- Pass 1: keyboard control loop validated (move, jump, grapple cooldown, beacon tag progression, exit unlock, win/lose overlay states).
- Pass 2: touch controls validated (left/right hold, jump/grapple trigger reliability, HUD readability on narrow viewport).

### Improvement checklist vs immediately previous game (Signal Breach)
- [x] Added vertical movement mastery layer with grapple bursts and momentum planning.
- [x] Added deterministic mission path (3 beacon tags then exit) for stronger progression readability.
- [x] Added clearer failure messaging for hazards/falls to improve retry learning.

## 5) Hub/Rotation Check
- Active game folders count: 13 (<= 30), archive rotation not required.
