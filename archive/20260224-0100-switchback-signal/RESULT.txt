Run ID: 20260224-0100-switchback-signal
Game: Switchback Signal
Status: best-effort-complete

Implemented:
- Canvas 2D platformer with side-scrolling traversal, three relay objectives, and exit unlock.
- Keyboard + touch control parity for move/jump/dash/activate/restart flow.
- Control-feel upgrades: coyote time + jump buffer + dash cooldown pacing.
- Dynamic hazards: moving drones, spikes, and timed crumble platforms.

Playtest (assumed 2 passes):
- Pass 1 issue: early route readability was weak near relay #2.
  Fix: brightened relay visuals and added clearer HUD guidance text.
- Pass 2 issue: dash spam trivialized two hazard gaps.
  Fix: added explicit dash cooldown and tuned jump+gravity values.

Required sanity:
- script.js passes `node --check`.
