Genre: Puzzle (grid/logic), Canvas 2D
Core loop: select-rotate-lock-synchronize-relays-within-move-budget
Previous vs Current improvements:
1) Jam Break Protocol's real-time wave shooter loop -> deterministic grid logic planning with undo/reset safety.
2) Added move-budget + best-score optimization layer for replayable mastery.
3) Simplified touch interaction to single-tap rotate/lock with full keyboard parity.
Controls: Keyboard (WASD/Arrows, Space/Enter, Q, U, R, N) + Touch (tap grid + Undo/Reset/New buttons)
Known issues: single board topology with shuffled rotations limits long-term variety; deployment blocked by DNS/network in this environment.
