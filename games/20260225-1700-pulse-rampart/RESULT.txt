Status: COMPLETE
Genre: Tower defense lite
Core loop: place-synergize-pulse-defend-upgrade-through-waves
Playtest pass 1: Early waves too easy; increased spawn scaling and reduced free gold.
Playtest pass 2: Pulse felt weak; increased slow duration and radius clarity.
Improvement checklist:
[x] Added active EMP skill layer (vs previous pure paddle deflection)
[x] Added dual-tower synergy choices (slow + sniper) and placement economy
[x] Added full touch parity for placement, preserving keyboard actions
