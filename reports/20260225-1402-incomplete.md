# 20260225-1402-incomplete

## Status
PARTIAL (Timed safety stop)

## What was attempted
- Executed `codex exec --full-auto` with PTY twice as required.
- Loaded and analyzed `games.json` structure and latest entries.
- Confirmed active game count is 30, so archive rotation was not required this run.

## Blocker
- Codex CLI session stalled during generation phase (no file mutations produced), so a complete new game package could not be finalized within the allowed window.

## Constraint checks prepared
- Next intended rotation after latest Brick-breaker was **Tower defense lite**.
- Planned anti-dup checks covered recent 5 core loops and lane-dodger/runner continuity.

## Pending items
- New game folder creation (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`, `README.md`, `RESULT.txt`, `thumbnail.png`)
- Hub/report metadata updates
- Git commit/push
- Vercel deployment URL capture

## Recommendation for next run
- Retry with a tighter Codex prompt focused on immediate file writes first, then metadata/deploy in a second Codex pass.
