- Rotation result: selected #1 Platformer (highest-priority genre not present in recent five).
- Non-dup core loop: jump-wallkick-phase-toggle-relic-extract.
- Lane-dodger/runner continuity: not used.

## 3) Lean Market Research
### Trends (3)
1. Short-session precision platformers with one signature traversal mechanic (dash/wall-kick/grapple) maintain retry motivation.
2. Hybrid action+puzzle platforming improves retention versus pure reflex obstacle chains.
3. Mobile-compatible action inputs (separate move/jump/action buttons) reduce early abandonment in browser runs.

### References (2)
1. Celeste Classic style fast retries and readable jump arcs.
2. VVVVVV style room-state switching as route planning pressure.

### Target Audience (1)
- Browser players who want 2-4 minute skill runs with quick restarts and visible mastery gains.

## 4) Quality Check
- Playtest assumption A (desktop): wall-kick window felt inconsistent; increased wall coyote frames for cleaner rebound jumps.
- Playtest assumption B (mobile): phase trigger taps were occasionally missed; enlarged action buttons and added stronger button contrast.

Checklist:
- [x] Canvas 2D only
- [x] Keyboard controls
- [x] Touch controls
- [x] Core loop unique vs recent 5
- [x] At least 2 improvements vs previous game
- [x] Win/Lose/Restart states

## 5) Previous vs Current Improvements
1. Shifted from momentum-combat mission to authored platform route with explicit traversal planning.
2. Added phase-state puzzle mechanic (A/B platforms) creating strategic timing decisions per jump chain.
3. Added wall-kick traversal assist and tighter mobile control mapping for accessibility.

## 6) Hub/Archive
- Updated `games.json`, root `index.html`, `README.md`, `reports/latest.md`, and `reports/index.html`.
- Active game count <= 30, so archive rotation not required.

## 7) Deployment
- Vercel: https://webgames-hub.vercel.app
