## 3) Lean Market Research
### Trends (3)
1. Session-length compression favors immediate action loops with clear mission state.
2. Mobile-first web players retain better when touch controls map to discrete combat verbs.
3. Tactical combo mechanics (mark + trigger payoff) increase replay curiosity.

### References (2)
1. Brotato-style short arena pressure and reset rhythm.
2. Nuclear Throne-style top-down readability and threat telegraphing.

### Target (1)
- "8-minute commuter player" who wants one intense run with simple controls and visible progress.

## 4) Quality Check
### Playtest assumption (2 passes)
- Pass 1: keyboard loop complete (move, fire, hack, win/lose transitions).
- Pass 2: touch controls validated (direction + FIRE/HACK), HUD readability checked.

### Improvement checklist
- [x] Mark-detonate tactical chain added
- [x] Dual relay hack objective added
- [x] Clearer extract/mission state feedback added
