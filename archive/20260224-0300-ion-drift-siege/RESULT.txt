Result: COMPLETE
Genre: Top-down shooter (Canvas 2D)
Core loop: kite enemies -> shoot -> capture uplinks -> survive wave

Playtest assumption
- Pass 1: verified keyboard movement/fire/dash and wave progression
- Pass 2: verified touch controls and lose/restart flow

Improvements vs previous game (Switchback Signal)
1) Added ranged combat + pursuit AI for combat readability and stronger moment-to-moment decisions.
2) Added dual objective layer (enemy clear + uplink capture) instead of pure traversal objective.
3) Added explicit touch button cluster for full parity on mobile.
