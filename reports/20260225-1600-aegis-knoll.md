# 20260225-1600-aegis-knoll (incomplete)

## Status
- Codex CLI (`codex exec --full-auto`, PTY) was invoked multiple times but stalled before writing the required game package beyond partial scaffolding.
- Per run safety rule (stop after timeout and preserve current state), this run is saved as incomplete.

## Partial artifacts
- `games/20260225-1600-aegis-knoll/index.html`
- `games/20260225-1600-aegis-knoll/style.css`

## Missing required artifacts
- `script.js`, `README.md`, `RESULT.txt`, `thumbnail.png`
- Hub metadata updates (`games.json`, root `README.md`, `index.html`)
- Deploy pipeline (`git push`, `vercel --prod`)

## Planned genre/core loop
- Genre: Tower defense lite (rotation target)
- Planned core loop: `place-synergize-trigger-pulse-hold-core`

## Blocker
- Codex session repeatedly entered long think/idle state and did not complete write/commit/deploy steps.
