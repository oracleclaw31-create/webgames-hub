# Hazard Serve

Hazard Serve is a Canvas 2D brick-breaker variant built around a charge-angle launch cycle instead of instant release.

## Controls
- Keyboard: `A/D` or `Left/Right` to move paddle, hold `Space` to charge and sweep launch angle, release `Space` to serve, `1/2/3` to pick perks, `R` to restart.
- Touch: hold `Left` / `Right` buttons to move, hold `Charge/Serve` to charge and set angle, release to launch, tap perk options between waves.

## Core Systems
- Charge-angle-serve launch with visible aiming line.
- Chain multiplier scoring that grows on consecutive brick breaks and resets on paddle contact (or miss).
- Timed hazard rows that push bricks downward at fixed intervals.
- Between-wave perk selection with three choices each clear.

## Objective
Survive hazard pressure, clear each wave, and keep high chain streaks for score scaling.
