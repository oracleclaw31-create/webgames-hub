# Run Report: 20260224-0400-lumen-lock

## Overview
- Genre: Rhythm/timing
- Core loop: scan target -> navigate cursor -> timed cross-toggle -> clear pattern -> gain time -> harder pattern
- Selection reason: recent 5 already included puzzle/platformer/shooter/tower-defense/brick-breaker variants, so this run uses timing-centric grid solving with a non-overlapping loop.

## Lean market research
### Trends (3)
1. Short-session “brain + reflex” hybrids improve replay in mobile web.
2. Visible target-state goals reduce onboarding friction versus opaque puzzle rules.
3. Time-bonus clear loops increase urgency without requiring heavy content pipelines.

### References (2)
- Lumines: rhythm-adjacent pressure and pattern clarity.
- Lights Out: elegant cross-toggle logic with simple controls.

### Target audience (1)
- Players seeking 2–5 minute tactical puzzle bursts on desktop and phone.

## Quality check (assumed 2 passes)
- Pass 1: keyboard controls, timer decay, level-up and score flow.
- Pass 2: touch tap behavior, on-screen buttons, restart flow.
- Improvement checklist complete: strategic readability, timing pressure, touch parity.

## Archive rotation
- Active games count <= 30 in this run, so no archive rotation required.
