Game: Neon Harvest

Previous Analysis:
- Previous game: Relay Grid (route-and-toggle puzzle).
- Recent 5 games: relay-grid only.
- Overlap check: avoided route/toggle puzzle loop; switched to collect-evade-bank arcade loop.

Improvement Goals:
1) Increase pacing and moment-to-moment tension with moving enemies and risk-reward banking.
2) Improve readability with single-canvas action field + immediate hit/bank feedback.
3) Preserve accessibility with keyboard + touch parity.

Playtest Assumptions:
- PT1: First-time players understand objective in under 20 seconds.
- PT2: Risk decision (keep collecting vs bank now) creates repeated engagement.
