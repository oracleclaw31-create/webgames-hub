# Cinder Sentinels

- Genre: Tower defense lite (Canvas 2D)
- Core loop: place-upgrade-hold-lanes-between-waves
- Controls: Keyboard (Arrows/1/2/Enter/Space/R) + Touch (tap tile/buttons)

## Improvements vs previous (Number Nexus)
1. Real-time tactical combat loop with wave pressure (from turn-based arithmetic puzzle).
2. Multi-input parity upgraded with direct touch placement and keyboard cursor build flow.
3. Added progression economy (scrap spend/earn) and two turret archetypes.
