# Rift Scrappers

Canvas 2D survival arena game.

## Genre
- Survival arena

## Core Loop
- Kite swarm enemies -> dash through clusters -> collect scrap -> release pulse blast -> choose upgrades -> survive longer waves.

## Controls
- Keyboard: WASD / Arrow keys move, Space/Shift dash, E/F pulse, R restart
- Touch: left side virtual drag movement, right-top dash, right-bottom pulse

## Improvements vs Previous (Ember Outpost)
1. Direct avatar control with dash i-frames creates higher moment-to-moment skill expression.
2. Scrap-to-upgrade branching introduces mid-run build variety instead of fixed tower slots.
3. Pulse meter adds timing-based crowd control and risk/reward decision making.
