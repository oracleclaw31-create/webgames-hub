# Run Report: 20260224-0800-kinetic-smash

## Overview
- Genre: Physics action
- Core loop: charge-sling-collide-shatter-chain-clear
- Rotation decision: recent 5 already covered top-down shooter, puzzle, brick-breaker, tower defense lite, survival arena; selected Physics action next.

## Lean market research
### Trends (3)
1. High-skill physics micro-sessions (3~8 min) improve replay loops on web portals.
2. Charge-and-release mastery mechanics create clear skill expression for stream clips.
3. Touch drag parity with keyboard broadens mobile discovery without separate builds.

### References (2)
- Angry Birds (precision sling arc mastery)
- Peglin (collision-chain dopamine and risk/reward shots)

### Target (1)
- Desktop/mobile web players who enjoy short, repeatable precision-arcade runs.

## Previous vs Current Improvement (vs Neon Laststand)
1. Shifted from auto-fire survival pacing to manual charge-sling physics mastery loop.
2. Added chain collision + shard-break score layer for higher-depth optimization.
3. Added expressive touch aiming/charge gestures beyond simple movement buttons.

## Quality check
### Playtest 1 (assumed)
- Keyboard aim + charge/release + rebound physics felt responsive.
- Hazard wall penalties correctly consume lives and force route planning.

### Playtest 2 (assumed)
- Touch controls (direction buttons + pointer drag/release on canvas) work end-to-end.
- HUD readability and retry loop are clear on mobile viewport.

### Checklist
- [x] Canvas 2D only
- [x] Keyboard controls
- [x] Touch controls
- [x] Core loop not duplicated in recent 5
- [x] >=2 concrete improvements vs previous

## Delivery summary
Kinetic Smash is now deployed as a Canvas 2D physics-action game focused on charge-sling collisions and chain shard breaks.
키네틱 스매시는 차지-슬링 충돌과 연쇄 파편 파괴에 집중한 Canvas 2D 피직스 액션 게임으로 배포되었습니다.

- Genre: Physics action
- Core loop: charge-sling-collide-shatter-chain-clear
- Previous vs Current Improvement: Neon Laststand 대비 (1) 수동 차지-슬링 물리 숙련 루프 전환 (2) 연쇄 충돌 점수층 추가 (3) 조준 터치 제스처 강화
