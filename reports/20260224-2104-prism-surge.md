## 1) Genre choice from recent 5
- Selected genre: **Brick-breaker (Canvas 2D)**
- Core loop uniqueness: 'charge-launch-angle-control-break-shield-waves' differs from puzzle/shooter/platformer/rhythm/physics recent loops.

## 2) Lean market research
### Trends (3)
1. Browser arcade players favor short mastery loops with immediate retry.
2. Touch + keyboard parity is baseline for retention.
3. Progression via multi-hit blocks increases depth without complexity.

### References (2)
- DX-Ball rebound control readability
- Multi-hit brick layering from modern web arcade clones

### Target persona (1)
- Mobile/desktop players wanting 3-6 minute skill sessions.

## 3) Implementation
- Canvas 2D only, no build step
- Inputs: keyboard + touch
- Required files included

## 4) Quality check (assumed playtests x2)
- Pass 1: rebound, HP blocks, life/reset loop verified
- Pass 2: touch controls and wave progression verified

## 5) Improvements vs previous
1. Deterministic puzzle flow -> real-time charge-shot action skill loop
2. Added 2HP shield bricks + phase escalation for clearer progression
