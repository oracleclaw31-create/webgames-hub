# Web Game Run Report — 20260223-1417-relay-grid

## 1) Previous + Recent 5 Analysis
- Previous game: none (hub had only starter placeholders).
- Recent 5: none available.
- Core loop overlap check: no overlap risk in this run because baseline is empty.

## 2) Improvement Goals (Declared)
1. Replace placeholder hub with a playable production artifact (game + docs + reports).
2. Establish repeatable reporting surface (latest pointer + report index + hub latest sections).
3. Improve interaction quality with dual input model (keyboard + touch).

## 3) Lean Market Research
### Trends (3)
1. Short-session puzzle loops (1–3 minute rounds) are favored for mobile web retention.
2. Hybrid input support (desktop + touch) improves shareability and completion rates.
3. Transparent progression/feedback HUD increases first-session finish probability.

### References (2)
- Daily puzzle engagement patterns from lightweight grid logic games (Wordle-like daily return behavior).
- Node-link routing mechanics seen in minimalist circuit/pipeline puzzle genres.

### Target (1)
- Target audience: casual puzzle players (ages 15–35) seeking quick, no-install browser challenges.

## 4) Implementation Summary
- Game title: Relay Grid
- Core loop: move + toggle relays + connect S→G + reach goal before timer expires.
- Tech: plain HTML/CSS/JS (no build).
- Input: Arrow/WASD + Space + touch buttons + tile tapping.

## 5) Playtest Assumption x2
- PT1: Users can complete Level 1 without external help.
- PT2: Users perceive Level 2 as meaningful step-up, not random difficulty spike.

## 6) Improvement Checklist
- [x] Distinct core loop documented
- [x] Improvement goals declared (>=2)
- [x] Keyboard + touch verified in implementation
- [x] Hub index updated (Latest Game / Latest Report / Recent Reports)
