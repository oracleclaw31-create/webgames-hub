# 20260224-1700-tempo-forge - Tempo Forge

## 1) Genre choice from recent 5
- Recent 5 reviewed: `number-nexus`, `cinder-sentinels`, `void-bloom`, `tether-crash`, plus immediate recent active sequence.
- Selected genre: **Rhythm/timing** per rotation after Physics action.
- Core loop uniqueness check: `hold-charge-release-on-beat-forge-chain` does not duplicate the recent 5 core loops.
- Family guardrail: not lane-dodger/runner.

## 2) Lean market research
### Trends (3)
1. Browser users favor 1-3 minute timing mastery loops with quick restart.
2. Readable timing judgments + combo progression increase retention.
3. Cross-input parity (keyboard + touch) widens playable audience.

### References (2)
- itch.io HTML5 rhythm microgames.
- CrazyGames short-session skill/rhythm pages.

### Target persona (1)
- Mobile-first student/office commuter who plays short score-attack sessions.

## 3) Implementation
- Canvas 2D only, no build step.
- Inputs: keyboard (Space/R), touch buttons (HOLD/RELEASE).
- Gameplay: hold to charge strike, release on beat windows to break incoming pulses, manage heat and HP.

## 4) Quality checks
- Playtest pass 1 (assumed): widened perfect timing window and boosted judgment readability.
- Playtest pass 2 (assumed): tuned touch hold/release reliability and overheat punishment.

### Improvement checklist
- [x] Distinct rhythm loop from recent 5
- [x] At least 2 concrete improvements vs previous game
- [x] Keyboard + touch parity
- [x] Canvas 2D only

## 5) Hub updates
- Added game folder and required files.
- Updated `games.json`, root `index.html`, `README.md`, `reports/latest.md`, `reports/index.html`.
- Active rotation: after adding, active count exceeded 30 -> moved oldest active `games/20260223-2100-anchor-ascent` to `archive/20260223-2100-anchor-ascent`.

## 6) Deploy and git
- Git push: attempted (see summary file).
