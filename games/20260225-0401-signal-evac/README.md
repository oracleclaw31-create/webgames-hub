# Signal Evac

- Genre: Top-down shooter (Canvas 2D)
- Core loop: sweep-shoot-rescue-escort-extract

## Controls
- Keyboard: WASD move, Arrow keys shoot, Shift dash, R restart
- Touch: on-screen move/shoot/dash buttons

## Lean market research
- Trends (3): short-session extraction shooters, objective-based combat loops, mobile-first dual-stick style controls.
- References (2): Enter the Gungeon (clear room pressure), Brotato (dense survival readability).
- Target (1): players who want 4–8 minute action runs with objective tension instead of pure score chase.

## Improvements vs previous (Grapple Grotto)
1. Added simultaneous movement + directional shooting for higher input depth.
2. Added squad objective layer (civilian follow/escort/extract) instead of single-goal relic pickup.
3. Added dash cooldown and enemy pressure management for tactical decision-making.
