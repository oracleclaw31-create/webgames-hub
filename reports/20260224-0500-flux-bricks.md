# Run Report: 20260224-0500-flux-bricks

## Overview
- Genre: Brick-breaker
- Core loop: position paddle -> pulse magnet -> curve rebounds -> break charged bricks -> chain combo -> clear stage
- Selection reason: analysis of the latest 5 `games.json` entries showed platformer/top-down shooter/puzzle-rhythm/tower-defense loops already present, so this run returns to brick-breaker with a distinct curve-control emphasis.

## Last 5 entry analysis
1. `20260223-2300-hazard-serve` - real-time serve chain arcade loop.
2. `20260224-0000-pulse-bastion` - tower defense lane economy loop.
3. `20260224-0100-switchback-signal` - platformer dash traversal loop.
4. `20260224-0300-ion-drift-siege` - top-down shooter capture-survive loop.
5. `20260224-0400-lumen-lock` - rhythm/timing puzzle toggle loop.

## Improvements vs immediately previous game
1. Upgraded from discrete grid cursor logic to continuous analog physics control and rebound mastery.
2. Added cooldown-driven magnet pulse mechanic for active shot shaping and higher skill expression.
3. Added stronger touch ergonomics with both hold buttons and direct canvas drag override.

## Lean market research
### Trends (3)
1. Web players respond well to low-friction arcade loops with one depth mechanic layered on top.
2. Session lengths under 5 minutes favor instant readability and immediate restart flow.
3. Mobile browser retention improves when touch interactions provide both coarse and fine control paths.

### References (2)
- Arkanoid (paddle control and rebound strategy baseline).
- Peggle (trajectory shaping and combo reward excitement).

### Target audience (1)
- Casual-to-core arcade players who want fast, mastery-oriented browser runs on phone and desktop.

## Quality check (assumed 2 passes)
- Pass 1 (keyboard): verified left/right response, magnet pulse cooldown timing, stage progression, fail/restart loop.
- Pass 2 (touch): verified hold-to-move buttons, magnet touch button, restart button, drag-to-position accuracy.

## Improvement checklist
- [x] At least 2 improvements against previous run.
- [x] Keyboard and touch controls both implemented.
- [x] Core loop is non-duplicate against latest 5 entries.
- [x] Lane-dodger/runner family not repeated consecutively.
