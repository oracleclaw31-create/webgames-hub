Run: 20260224-1601-tether-crash
Genre: Physics action
Core loop: thrust-hook-sling-impact-detonate-before-timeout
Playtest pass 1 (assumed): early collisions were too punishing at low speed; raised heavy-impact threshold and reduced chip damage.
Playtest pass 2 (assumed): touch drag sensitivity and button hold states tuned for stable grapple/brake behavior on mobile.
Known issues: no audio, no stage variety beyond core placement.
Status: Built and hub-integrated.
